            <li>My goal is to become a developer. All my life I've been interested in computer technology, 
                but development has bypassed me. Computer science at school was an insanely uninteresting subject 
                on which the teacher did not tell us anything useful, and in the end, I chose the path of the humanities. 
                Now in my life came that turning point when I firmly decided to radically change it. 
                I want to learn something new, meet interesting people, do things that I like. 
                I need to bring real benefits and see the results of my work. IT can give me all of this. 
                I am not a stupid person and i can learn easily and quickly. I'm patient, sociable and responsible, 
                i have critical thinking. Every step, every turn on the path of life, 
                every episode and statistical incredibility that brought me here helped me understand that if you got a chance, you shouldn't stop.</li>
            <li>I have no skills in programming right now, but I came <a href="https://rs.school/js/" target="_blank">here</a> to got it cause i have skills in education.</li>

                const func = (num) => {  
                    if (num > 0) {  
                      return num - 1;  
                    }
                    return num + 1;  
                  };
